### 1. `const express = require('express');`
- This line imports the **Express** library into the application. Express is a web application framework for Node.js, which makes it easier to handle routing, requests, and responses in a web server.

### 2. `const path = require('path');`
- This imports the **path** module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths in Node.js. It helps ensure that file paths are correctly formed, especially when working across different operating systems.

### 3. `const app = express();`
- This initializes an **Express application** by calling the `express()` function. `app` is now an instance of the Express framework, which can be used to configure the server, define routes, and handle requests.

### 4. `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;`
- This sets the **port number** for the server. It first checks if an environment variable `PORT` exists (which might be used in deployment environments like Heroku or other cloud services). If `PORT` is not set, it defaults to `8080`.

### 5. `app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));`
- This line tells the Express server to serve static files from a **public directory**.
  - `express.static` is a built-in middleware function in Express that serves static files (like HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript files).
  - `path.join(__dirname, 'public')` constructs an absolute path to the `public` folder based on the current file's location (`__dirname`). This ensures compatibility across different operating systems.

### 6. `app.get('/', (req, res) => {`
- This defines a **GET route** for the root URL `/`. When the server receives a request to the root URL (`http://localhost:PORT/`), it will respond with a specific file.
  - `req` stands for the request object, and `res` stands for the response object. These objects represent the HTTP request and response, respectively.    

### 7. `res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'webPage_Intro.html'));`
- When the root URL is accessed, this line sends the file `webPage_Intro.html` located in the `public` directory as the response.
  - `path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'webPage_Intro.html')` constructs the absolute path to the file using the current directory and the `public` folder.

### 8. `});`
- This closes the `app.get()` method's callback function, which handles the GET request for the root route.

### 9. `app.listen(PORT, () => {`
- This starts the **Express server** on the specified port (`PORT`).
  - The `listen()` method takes a callback function that is executed once the server is up and running. In this case, the callback is used to log a message to the console.

### 10. `console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);`
- This logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running and accessible at the specified `PORT` (either from an environment variable or `8080` by default).

### 11. `});`
- This closes the `app.listen()` method's callback function, completing the server startup process.
