# Website_CyberWing_ICET
The Cyber Wing of Ilahia College of Engineering and Technology (ICET) plays a crucial role in fostering cyber security awareness, research, and education among students. As part of an initiative to enhance its digital presence, this project aims to develop a dedicated website that serves as an informational hub, learning platform, and event management system for the Cyber Wing.

The website will provide resources, event details, membership information, and interactive content to engage students, faculty, and industry professionals interested in cyber security. Additionally, it will serve as a centralized portal for updates, training programs, and collaborations with external organizations.
